1D Fluid model of collisionless Ar plasma sheath for electrons and ions

Electrode potential in equivalent circuit model

First block:
    \
    Self-consistent solution of Poisson equation, electrons and ions momentum balance, and
    electron and ion continuity equation

Second block:
\
Monte-Carlo simulation of ion transport across the sheath 


TODO:
    \
    - boundary conditions or Vdc calculation
    \
    - initial conditions or solution convergence
