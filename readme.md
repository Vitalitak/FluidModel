1D Fluid model of collisionless Ar plasma sheath and presheath for electrons and ions


First block:
\
Self-consistent solution of stationary system of Poisson equation, electrons and ions momentum balance, and
electron and ion continuity equation
\
Electron and ions are isothermal. No elastic collisions. Ionization rate proportional electron concentration.

Second block:
\
Self-consistent solution of dynamic system with solution of stationary system as initial conditions.

Third block:
\
Monte-Carlo simulation of ion transport across the sheath
